This README file is for the C++ version of the Pascal compiler, Chapter 8.

The makefile enables you to compile the C++ version of the 
Pascal compiler source files, and then run the Pascal compiler 
(and interpreter) and the sample Pascal programs. The makefile
should work on the Mac, Linux, Windows platforms. You need the
'make' utility, which is normally already installed on Mac and 
Linux platforms: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

If you are on Windows, you must first install
the GNU g++ compiler and the 'bash', 'rm', and 'make' 
utilities from Cygwin: https://www.cygwin.com/ 

To compile the compiler source files, you need the C++ Boost
include files. Download them from http://www.boost.org/
On the Mac and Linux platforms, you normally install the include 
files in directory /usr/local/include/boost. If you install them 
anywhere else, or if you're on Windows, then set the value of  
variable BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR in the makefile. You do not need to 
install the Boost libraries.

The following are examples of make commands. The makefile must be in
the current directory, or specify its location with the -f option.

make clean

    Remove all generated Pascal compiler files to start fresh.

make

    Compile all the Pascal compiler source files and generate 
    an executable Pascal compiler (and interpreter).

make interpret src=hello.pas

    Run the sample Pascal program hello.pas using the interpreter.

make compile src=hilbert.pas

    Compile the sample Pascal program hilbert.pas. 

make dependencies

    File makefile_dependencies.txt encodes dependencies of the 
    Pascal compiler's .cpp source files on their .h header files. 
    You do not need to remake this file unless you modified any of 
    the compiler source files (or added new ones) and changed the 
    header file dependencies. To remake makefile_dependencies.txt, 
    first compile depends.cpp (g++ -o depends depends.cpp) and set 
    the value of variable DEPENDS_UTILITY in the makefile. Then run
    the above command before before rebuilding the Pascal compiler.
